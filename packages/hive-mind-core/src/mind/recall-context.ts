/**
 * recall-context.ts — shared renderer for surfacing temporal information in
 * recalled-memory blocks. Single source of truth imported by both the Waggle
 * agent (production) and the benchmark harness, so the injected-memory format
 * never drifts between the two.
 *
 * Scope (Temporal Substrate Fix, Phase 1 — "surface time", additive only):
 *  - Prefix each retrieved snippet with its own compact `[YYYY-MM-DD]` date.
 *  - Open the rendered memory block with one anchor line giving the most-recent
 *    memory date, so the model has a concrete "now" to resolve relative time
 *    expressions against.
 *  - Export `TEMPORAL_GUIDANCE`, the prompt fragment that tells the model to
 *    treat those timestamps as the anchor for relative-time arithmetic.
 *
 * Distilled "Memory Facts" (cross-session syntheses) are intentionally NOT
 * dated here — they have no single reliable date. Phase 2 handles them.
 *
 * OSS-clean: pure string formatting, no vault/evolution/compliance deps.

/**
 * Prompt fragment wired into the memory-recall injection path (NOT the global

 *
 * W4.1 upgrade (W4-PRODUCTION-PORT-PLAN-2026-06-11.md §1): replaced the original
 * "nearest timestamp as anchor" phrasing with the benchmark-proven W1 wording —
 * concrete relative-date arithmetic with worked examples (Memori instruction-5
 * lineage, incl. the verified conv-26 "yesterday" failure case) plus the
 * granularity-calibration clause (failure mining: 22 temporal fails emitted a
 * confident exact ISO day 1-7 days off where a coarse answer was correct).
 * Temporal was the #1 LoCoMo lever (80.06 → 84.7 across W1-W3.1).
 * Production-safe subset: no never-refuse clause (that was benchmark-cell
 * policy only — conditional abstention stays).
